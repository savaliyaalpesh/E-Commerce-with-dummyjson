Project: E-commerce Web Application
Description:
Developed a fully functional e-commerce web application using React, Redux, React Router, and Bootstrap. The application features a dynamic product listing, a detailed product view, and a shopping cart functionality. Key highlights include:

Product Listing: Implemented a product listing page that fetches and displays products from an external API. Users can filter products by categories and search for specific products using a search bar.
Product Details: Designed a detailed product view page that showcases product images, descriptions, prices, and stock availability. Users can add products to their cart directly from this page.
Shopping Cart: Built a shopping cart system using Redux for state management, allowing users to add, remove, and adjust product quantities. The cart icon updates in real-time to reflect the number of items in the cart.
Search Functionality: Integrated a search feature in the header component, enabling users to search for products and view the results on a dedicated search results page.
Responsive Design: Utilized Bootstrap to ensure the application is fully responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, React Router, Bootstrap, Axios
State Management: Redux
Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub
This project demonstrates proficiency in building interactive and user-friendly web applications, managing state effectively with Redux, and integrating third-party APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.
